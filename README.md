# todododo

My first attempt on creating a beta [tododo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImhfIv5NSqY) app with beta (version 2) framework Flutter with beta database Firestore. Working a simple CRUD application.

## Getting Started

For help getting started with Flutter, view our online
[documentation](https://flutter.io/).

To run the app:

1. Make sure your environment is aye okay: `flutter doctor`
2. Use your own firebase initialisation. 
3. Then run `flutter run`. If you have more than one devices connected: `flutter run -d all`
